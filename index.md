## Week 6
In week 6 we came up with the idea of the Mood Bracelet, did some research on what products are similat to our mood bracelet idea and come up with a little bit of ideas on how it will work. We also thoguht of some materals that we coul duse as the band for the bracelet that will also work with the mocrobit. It has to be comfortable for users, easy to use (take off and put on) and also needs to work well with a microbit. Within this I also did a sketch on roughly how we want the bracelet to look with the microbit.
