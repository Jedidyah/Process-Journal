## Week 9
In week 9 we started to come up with more ideas of how the microbit would look and work, while also trying to come up with the coding for the facial expressions that will show on the front of the Microbit. We also began to experiment with different buts and pieces and other parts such as a different type of microbit (not called a microbit but it is a smaller piece that was considered for the project) and also a heart rate monitor. 
Below is an image of the coding software used:

In week 7 we started to work on some of the coding for the task. An image of some of the coding that we will use is shown below. We also ustillised this week to start preparing the script for the presentation. The code below is to help us be able to get the microbit to measure the heart rate of the person wearing it.
