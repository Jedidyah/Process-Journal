## Week 9
In week 9 we started to come up with more ideas of how the microbit would look and work, while also trying to come up with the coding for the facial expressions that will show on the front of the Microbit. We also began to experiment with different buts and pieces and other parts such as a different type of microbit (not called a microbit but it is a smaller piece that was considered for the project) and also a heart rate monitor. 
Below is an image of the coding software used:

## Week 12 + Week 13
During this time frame, the classes consisted of a lot of working on our projects using the universities matierials and finalising our products. During this week we finalised our coding to a point that was satisfactory to us even though it was not perfect and also filmed and took images of our mood bracelet to creat the video rercording. After class was finished, we focused on creating the script for the video of the mood bracelet and then Angelique put all of the videos together and put the voice recordings into the film as well, completing the last task for this subject.
